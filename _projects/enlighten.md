Enlighten is a multiplayer webgame, using Node.js and Socket.io for multiple players, and hosted on Heroku's PAAS.

Inspired by other webgames, Enlighten is centered around cooperation; rather than players competing against each other, they band together to advance. Hence, the more players online, the easier it is to traverse the levels.

Initially, I started this project to learn JavaScript and how to handle client and server-side code. It is still in development, with many features planned. Currently, there are three levels available with increasing difficulty.
