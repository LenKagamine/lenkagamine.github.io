#### **I'm Michael Kim, a Computer Science student currently at the University of Waterloo.**

I'm an aspiring software developer who listens to music all day.

I love coding, computers, music, and gaming. Combining all my favourites together, I often create games for fun and to learn new languages and tools.

I'm always passionate about learning new concepts, and understanding how things works. My ideal way of learning something new is to dive in and create a project with it.

Whenever I'm not writing code, I'm usually listening to music, wondering what to create next, or blowing some steam with games.

This website showcases all of my projects, ranging from [web development] to [working with hardware].
